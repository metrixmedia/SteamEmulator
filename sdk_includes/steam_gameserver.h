// - usSteamPort is the local port used to communicate with the steam servers.
//   NOTE: unless you are using ver old Steam client binaries, this parameter is ignored, and
//         you should pass 0.  Gameservers now always use WebSockets to talk to Steam.
//         This protocol is TCP-based and thus always uses an ephemeral local port.
//         Older steam client binaries used UDP to talk to Steam, and this argument was useful.
//         A future version of the SDK will remove this argument.
// - unIP will usually be zero.  If you are on a machine with multiple IP addresses, you can pass a non-zero
//   value here and the relevant sockets will be bound to that IP.  This can be used to ensure that
//   the IP you desire is the one used in the server browser.
// - usGamePort is the port that clients will connect to for gameplay.  You will usually open up your
//   own socket bound to this port.
// - usQueryPort is the port that will manage server browser related duties and info
//		pings from clients.  If you pass STEAMGAMESERVER_QUERY_PORT_SHARED for usQueryPort, then it
//		will use "GameSocketShare" mode, which means that the game is responsible for sending and receiving
//		UDP packets for the master  server updater.  (See ISteamGameServer::HandleIncomingPacket and
//		ISteamGameServer::GetNextOutgoingPacket.)
// - The version string should be in the form x.x.x.x, and is used by the master server to detect when the
//		server is out of date.  (Only servers with the latest version will be listed.)
